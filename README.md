## üéØ Problem Statement
The organization faces challenges in achieving consistent growth and optimizing profitability due to a lack of clear, centralized visibility into sales performance. Specifically:

- **Performance Gaps:** There is a need to identify underperforming regions and low-margin product categories that are draining resources.

- **Strategic Direction:** Business leaders lack a unified view to make data-driven decisions regarding inventory, marketing spend, and sales force allocation.

This project was initiated to transform raw sales transaction data into a functional, intuitive dashboard that provides actionable insights, enabling the business to maximize revenue and increase net profit across all dimensions.|
